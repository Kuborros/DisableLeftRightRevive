# DisableLeftRightRevive

Made for a request on discord.

Dirtiest hack known to man, it simply sets the timer to enable L/R input to value high enough that it wont activate anytime soon. Does the inverse effect on the delay for revive by button spam (its a feature in the game!)

Dont expect it posted on GameBanana, or any real support if you use it, this is not a release ready mod.
